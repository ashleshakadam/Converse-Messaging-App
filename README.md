# Converse-Messaging-App

Converse, is an instant messaging chat application, developed using, Python, HTML, JavaScript and Shell. The project mostly leverages socket programming and multi-thread processing techniques. The chat functionality lets users create personal accounts from where they will send messages to other chat apps users. A server is setup to handle user requests to connect and exchange messages in real-time.

## Setup

Ensure you have python 3.9.0+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server

```bash
cd website
python main.py
```

## Clearing Message History

To clear the message history simply delete the `messages.db` file.

## Old Message Server

I created a custom message server using Python sockets,Â before implementing socketio for this project. 'old msg server/' has the necessary code.
